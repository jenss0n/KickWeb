        <p><span>That’s awful in the latest film by Julio Medem has nothing to do with its star and co-producer,
            Penélope Cruz. She is absolved of responsibility, purely for reminding us of her scintillating screen
            presence. Embarrassing, second-banana roles in big budget English-language comedies such as Grimsby and
            (pardon my French) Zoolander 2 required her to stand in a cat-suit and pout. They signalled that she’d all
            but thrown in the towel when it came to “serious” acting.<br><br>

            But the first half of Ma Ma reminds us of the fiery star of Jamón, Jamón and Volver. She plays the
            headstrong Magda, a single mother who, in the film’s opening scene, chuckles defiantly when she is diagnosed
            with breast cancer. Though an urgent mastectomy is required, the prognosis is positive. She remains in high
            spirits, joking with her lovelorn doctor (Àlex Brendemühl), keeping the news from her footballing ace
            son,and finding a sturdy leaning post in recent widower, Arturo (Luis Tosar).<br><br>

            Medem builds a plot around coincidence and bad fortune which almost works because of the heavy stylisation
            in the shooting and editing. But where the first half of the film is dashed with trauma and tragedy, it
            never descends into maudlin histrionics, helped no end by Cruz’s confident, dryly humourous and dolefully
            empathetic turn. Yet there seems to have been a complete change of tack at around the half way mark, as the
            story divebombs into the most nauseating aria of artery-clagging sentimentality replete with CG beating
            heart to keep extra tabs on Magda’s wavering health.<br><br>

            Cold reason turns to cockeyed fantasy – it’s like you can see the film giving up on life and staggering to a
            climax so horrendously misjudged that you, too, will have to check your pulse to make sure that this is
            actually happening. Seriously, it’s like the final four of five shots of the film are at war with one
            another in the world cornball idiocy championships. Yet, there’s enough here to suggest Medem has the eye
            and the nous for a big, important return after nearly a decade in the wilderness.<br>

        <p>Elijah Wood spends most of The Trust sporting a facial expression somewhere between bemused and horrified.
            Considering his co-star is Nicolas Cage, master of the fabled “nouveau shamanic” acting technique, this is
            understandable. Take an early scene at a bar when Cage steals a lemon slice from his colleague’s glass,
            covers it in Tabasco and chows it down. You can’t help but wonder, was this written in the screenplay? But
            where other directors might simply let the actor run ramshod for 90 minutes, newcomers Alex and Benjamin
            Brewer seem to have tried pointing him in a straight line.<br><br>

            The result is a breezy heist movie not unlike
            its lead actor: it might veer of the straight and narrow, but it’s never dull. Cage and Wood star as Jim
            Stone and David Waters, Las Vegas cops who have slipped into corruption purely by dint of being too smart to
            simply be incompetent. Through some of-the-books sleuthing and a series of discoveries that are never quite
            properly explained, they stumble upon evidence of a secret vault in the back of a convenience store which
            they believe to be stufed with dirty cash. A fairly standard preparation montage (procuring tools, scouting
            out the location) is elevated at every turn by Cage, poring over plans with his nose covered in sunscreen,
            or ordering drill bits in broken German. For most of the first act, it feels Cage-lite (think his phoned-in
            Johnny Blaze from Ghost Rider), but the Brewers slacken his leash just enough to drive up the tension as the
            heist proper begins.<br><br>

            The Trust may not break new ground in the genre, but it’s a handsomely made example of a tried and tested
            formula. Cinematographer Sean Porter eschews the garish neon hues of the Vegas Strip for a cooler colour
            palate, and Reza Safinia’s up-tempo score helps to keep up the pace. Crucially, it doesn’t outstay its
            welcome. Casting Cage is a gamble, but the Brewers are wise enough to know when to walk away
            from the table. <b>PHIL W BAYLES</b>
