        <h6>„IN PORTFOLIO, THE MAKERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO SHOW THE INDUSTRY AS BEING FUN AND ENRICHING, BUT IT ACTUALLY
            COMES ACROSS AS AN OUTSIDER AS BEING QUITE DULL.“</h6>

        <h7><b>EL:</b> That might be because being a model is incredibly boring.<br>
            ML: Ahahaha, come on?!<br>
            EL: It is!<br><br>

            <b>ML:</b> Portfolio is strange because it was produced by John Casablancas, the founder of Elite (and the father
            of JulianCasablancas of The Strokes), so it presents a very positive image of the industry. Yet at the same
            time it is pretty accurate.<br><br>

            <b>EL:</b> It shows modelling as work. Boring work, where you’re just standing there looking nice, or difficult
            work, where you have to repeat the same thing over and over, look happy, etc. It’s work.<br><br>

            <b>ML:</b> But the models in the film understand that, so they just try to make time pass by chatting and being
            nice to one another. At one point, I was surprised that the director had kept in a scene where a model is
            shooting some lingerie outside and she says to the stylist,‘What the hell am I wearing?!’ and then laughs.
            They don’t take it too seriously, and that’s how the biggest models roll.</h7>

        <h6>„HOW TYPICAL WAS THE HEROINE OF PORTFOLIO? SHE SEEMS TO REPRESENT THE HOLLYWOOD DREAM CHASER IDEAL?“</h6>
    </div>
    <div class="runningtext2">
        <h7><b>ML:</b> It may seem a bit too American-dream like, but for many models, that’s how it happens. You come from a
            small town where one person who seems to know about this industry tells you you have a chance to become a
            great model. You try it, you don’t know whether it’s a good idea, or if it will work, then you see that it’s
            just a job.<br><br>

            The main character is very down to earth, but the problem with girls when they start out is that sometimes
            they get ideas. They think they’re going to become actual princesses, and that can make for a lot of
            disappointment.</h7>

    <div class="runningtext3">
        <h7><b>EL:</b> Lacking from this film is the sense of emptiness and sometimes loneliness you get, which is very much
            present in Gia.<br><br>

            <b>ML:</b> Yes, Portfolio makes it look like really fun work. And it says at some point, ‘all models are nice!’
            which is obviously not true.</h7>
